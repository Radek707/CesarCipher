Commodity Markets: Evolution Challenges and Policies is a broad-ranging analysis of
just about everything you have ever wanted to know about commodity markets. It has
a broad sweep of commodity prices and production (primarily energy, metals, and
agricultural commodities) over the past century, carefully documenting and rigorously
analyzing the important difference in experiences across different groups of
commodities. It is comprehensive in its historical coverage but also addresses
contemporary issues such as an insightful analysis of the impact of the COVID19
pandemic and the Ukraine war on commodity prices. It draws out the impact of
shocks, technology, and policy as drivers of demand and supply for a range of different
commodities. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the drivers of
commodity prices and production over the last century and the implications for future
trends.
For sound global development, the next few years are critical in adopting policies
that allow rapid growth in median income and the income of the world’s poor.
Inflation and commodity market volatility have contributed to the reversals in
development in recent years, undermining poverty reduction and the energy
transition. Over time, demand for commodities will have to be met by greater
productive capacity—either through technological advances or the substitution of
one commodity for another. A sound goal is for the shifts in commodity markets
to encourage good outcomes for both development and environmental
Climate change and the transition from fossil fuels to zero-carbon sources of energy
add another dimension to the uncertainties that roil commodity markets. Extreme
weather events will become increasingly common and can affect the production of
many commodities. The energy transition—intended to minimize the worst effects
of climate change—is altering patterns of commodity production and
consumption. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to be flat or decline over the next
few decades, while demand for metals is likely to rise due to the higher metals
content of renewable energy infrastructure. On the policy front, COVID-19-
related supply disruptions and the war in Ukraine could lead to increased
protectionism on energy-security and food self-sufficiency grounds, as well as
fragmentation of trade, investment, and financial networks.
