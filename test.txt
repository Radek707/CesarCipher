Commodity prices surged in the immediate
aftermath of the war in Ukraine, particularly for
commodities for which Russia and Ukraine are
key exporters (figure SF.1). Commodity prices
have been extremely volatile, with volatility for
some commodities (e.g., coal, nickel, and wheat)
reaching record highs in February and March
2022. THe recent rise in prices reflects supply
disruptions, higher input costs, and geopolitical
risk premia. It comes on top of already tight
commodity markets driven by a strong demand
recovery from the pandemic, and numerous
pandemic-related supply constraints. Reflecting
these developments, between January 2020 and
December 2021, the World Bankâ€™s energy and
non-energy price indexes increased by 50 and 40
percent, respectively, while between January and
March 2022 the two indexes rose an additional 34
and 13 percent.
