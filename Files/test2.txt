At the same time, commodity price booms and busts frequently lead to calls for
additional actions to protect consumers or producers. Price spikes for food and
energy can have a disproportionate effect on the poorest households and have often
led to subsidies or trade measures. For example, the war in Ukraine led to
significant energy price spikes and resulted in many governments reducing fuel
taxes or increasing other energy subsidies, as well as releasing strategic oil
inventories. At the international level, attempts to mitigate market volatility can
take the form of coordinated supply measures to achieve price goals. While such
policies may be necessary as a short-term transitional tool, their use should be
temporary. History suggests that the prolonged use of these policy instruments has
generally led to undesirable consequences.
Exposure to commodity-market risks is most pronounced for countries that depend
on a narrow range of resource-based exports. The underlying vulnerability can be
addressed through structural changes in the economy and well-designed
macroeconomic policy frameworks. For example, while economic diversification is
expected to reduce the risks of terms-of-trade shocks, direct government
intervention to achieve diversification is not only seldom successful but also goes
against the comparative advantage that countries may possess. A more promising
approach is to create a business climate that favors innovation and investment
throughout the economy. The establishment of sovereign wealth funds can enable
