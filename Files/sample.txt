The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused major disruptions to the supply of commodities. Both
countries are key exporters of energy and agricultural products. The disruptions have
exacerbated existing stresses in commodity markets following the recovery from the COVID-
19 pandemic, which saw rebounding global demand and constrained supplies after 2020. As a
result, commodity price volatility has surged, with
food prices reaching levels not seen since the
2007-08 price spikes. Beyond their broader
impact on inflation, supply disruptions of key
commodities could severely affect a wide range of
industries, including food, construction,
petrochemicals, and transport. Concerns about
energy and food security have already prompted
ad hoc policy responses to bolster national selfsufficiency
and reduce energy prices for
consumers; however, these policies often fall short
of effectively solving the underlying problems.
Against this background, this Special Focus
addresses the following questions:
What has been the near-term impact of the
war on commodity markets? What are the main lessons of past commodity
price shocks? What are the key policy implications?
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a major shock to commodity markets. The war has led to significant
disruptions to the production and trade of commodities for which Russia and Ukraine are key exporters. Prices
have risen sharply for all energy commodities and some food commodities, including wheat and oilseeds. This, in
turn, has raised energy and food security concerns, especially for the poorest households. In response to price
hikes, policymakers have often sought to provide relief to consumers via subsidies or lower taxes; however, these
are generally ineffective remedies and may exacerbate supply shortages. Policymakers can better mitigate the
impact of higher prices on low-income households through targeted measures, including cash transfers. Past
commodity price shocks induced policy and market responses that led to increased sources of supply and, for oil
price shocks, greater consumption efficiency and substitution away from oil. Over time, the recent spike in prices
will likely once again spur more efficient energy consumption and a faster transition away from fossil fuels,
particularly if supported by appropriate policy responses. Food production, at the global level, will also respond
to changes in relative prices. However, the uncertainties for food supply availability stemming from the war are
high, and low-income countries may have urgent needs for international assistance for a prolonged period.
Amid overlapping crises over the past two years and the ongoing transition to lower
carbon intensity, commodity markets are being reshaped. COVID-19 highlighted
the volatility of these markets: global shocks can boost or drop prices sharply and
suddenly, with destabilizing consequences for developing economies. The war in
Ukraine has made the security of energy and supply chains a more prominent goal,
even if it entails higher costs. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are shifting
demand away from fossil fuels while increasing demand for the metals and materials
needed to build solar and wind infrastructure and battery storage. The sudden
disruption of natural gas markets, which have often been providing electricity base
load during peak demand, brought new concerns about grid stability, grid capacity
when adding intermittent renewables, and a global return to coal and diesel
electricity generation.
This book offers a comprehensive analysis of major commodity markets and
analyzes how changes in these markets affect the economies of developing countries.
Over the next three decades, the growth of global demand for commodities is likely
to decelerate as population growth slows, with many developing economies
maturing and shifting their demand mix more toward consumption and services.
The energy transition is likely to bring a major boost to metal-producing economies
because technologies related to renewable energy tend to be more metals-intensive.
The ongoing transformation of global commodity markets will have profound
implications for countries that depend on commodity production for economic
growth, exports, and fiscal revenues. Countries that depend on commodities
account for half of the worldâ€™s extreme poor. But the report suggests there may be
differentiation among exporters: fossil-fuel exporters could see a decline in revenues
while metals exporters reap windfall gains as the energy transition proceeds.
